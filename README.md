### Linguist Â· Translation technologist

Skype: `msoutopico` (time zone: GMT+1/CET)

Originally a Galician/Spanish language specialist and translator from English, Portuguese, French and Catalan, I have evolved towards a translation technologist specializing in terminology management, localization engineering, CAT tool consultancy and QA automation. I speak the languages above as well as some Arabic, and my interests include freediving, playing accordion, dancing and photography.

I studied translation and interpreting in Vigo and applied linguistics at IULA (UPF) in Barcelona and have taught myself some programming in PHP, Javascript, Python and basic Groovy with a view to developing language solutions. I have learned about the technical and quality sides of the translation industry working as a terminologist and language coordinator in leading localization companies such as STAR and Lionbridge.

After working as a freelance translator/linguist and translation technologist for some years, today I work as lead translation technologist at cApStAn, where I help the translators, language experts and PMs make the best possible use of their CAT tool (configuring it, training them, giving them support) and I develop some applications to automate some of their tasks and to increase their access to technology and resources.
