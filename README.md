### Linguist Â· Translation technologist

Skype: `msoutopico` (time zone: GMT+1/CET)

I am a Galician/Spanish language specialist and I translate from English, Portuguese, French and Catalan. I speak some Arabic too.

I studied translation and interpreting in Vigo and applied linguistics at IULA (UPF) in Barcelona and have taught myself some scripting language programming with a view to developing language solutions.

I have learned about the technical and quality sides of the translation industry working as a terminologist and language coordinator in leading localization companies such as STAR and Lionbridge.

I have worked as a freelance translator/linguist and translation technologist for some years, specializing in terminology management, localization engineering, CAT tool consultancy and QA automation.

Nowadays I am the lead translation technologist at cApStAn, where I help the translators, language experts and project managers use their translation environment tool (configuring it, training them, giving them support) and I develop some applications for them to automate some tasks and to increase access to technology and resources.
